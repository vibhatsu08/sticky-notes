Title - Sticky notes website</br>
ProjectLog[0] - Gave some basic styling to the webpage. </br>
ProjectLog[1] - In this log, i will be fixing the bug with the website where the sticky notes are leaking out of the parent container. </br>
ProjectLog[2] - In this log, i will be working on adding more styling to the elements for the webpage. I will be adding a bit of a degree transform to the notes to make them a little bit like the sticky notes in real life. Also, everything aligns properly with proper padding and the notes align themselves in the parent container responsively. </br>
ProjectLog[3] - Removed the angle tilt for the notes for the time being, Instead added a transform property where that particular note scales up when hovered upon.</br>
